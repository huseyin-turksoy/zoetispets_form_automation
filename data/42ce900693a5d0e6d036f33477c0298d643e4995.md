          - paragraph [ref=e40]: We highly recommend taking your cat to the vet for a full check up. If you provided your email address then we just emailed you a handy report for you to show to your vet to help them understand what's happening and whether pain management is required. You can also learn more below about the signs you just selected in our online assessment.

                - heading "Difficulty going up stairs" [level=4] [ref=e53]
                - paragraph [ref=e54]: Climbing stairs exacerbates joint pain due to increased pyhsical demands on joints affected by arthritis. You may have noticed that your cat has adjusted how they move when climbing stairs or they may now avoid stairs completely. Some cats ‘bunny hop’ up the stairs rather than moving their legs separately. Even on short flights of stairs, cats with arthritis often stop for a break midway.
              - generic [ref=e56]:
                - heading "Difficulty going down stairs" [level=4] [ref=e58]
                - paragraph [ref=e59]: Coming down the stairs can be challenging for cats experiencing arthritis pain. Some cats descend at an angle to reduce the pressure placed on their sore elbows and shoulders in order to avoid this pain.

                - heading "Has trouble sleeping" [level=4] [ref=e65]
                - paragraph [ref=e66]: Discomfort from arthritis disrupts sleep patterns. You may notice your cat searching for alternative resting spots because they are trying to alleviate pressure on painful joints. They may also appear to struggle as they try to find a comfortable resting position because of the arthritis pain they are experiencing.
              - generic [ref=e68]:
                - heading "Has accidents outside the litter tray / box" [level=4] [ref=e70]
                - paragraph [ref=e71]: Joint pain can make it difficult for your cat to get into their litter tray, as even the simple act of stepping over the sides might cause them discomfort. Your cat may do their best to reach the tray, but the arthritis pain they are experiencing could prevent them from getting inside, leading to accidents nearby.

              - paragraph [ref=e90]: It's unlikely that your cat will show the signs that you've noticed while they are being assessed by your vet. To help your vet understand what you are noticing, take a video on your phone of each of these signs so that you can show them.
            - generic [ref=e92]:
              - heading "Your cat’s diet and weight" [level=4] [ref=e93]
              - paragraph [ref=e94]: Being overweight might worsen arthritis pain and make your cat’s movement uncomfortable. Your vet can recommend a diet for your cat that will help them to maintain an optimum weight.
            - generic [ref=e96]:
              - heading "Any medication, alternative treatments or supplements your cat is taking for arthritis pain" [level=4] [ref=e97]
